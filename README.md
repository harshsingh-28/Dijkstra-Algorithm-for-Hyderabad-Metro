# Dijkstra-Algorithm-for-Hyderabad-Metro

Dijkstra's algorithm is a fundamental algorithm in computer science for finding the shortest path between nodes in a graph. Named after Dutch computer scientist Edsger Dijkstra, the algorithm efficiently explores the graph, assigning tentative distances to nodes and gradually updating them as it identifies shorter paths. Using a priority queue to select the next node to visit, Dijkstra's algorithm guarantees the shortest path to all nodes from a specified starting point, making it a crucial tool in network routing and optimization problems.
In the context of the Hyderabad Metro, Dijkstra's algorithm can be applied as a powerful tool for optimizing train routes and determining the most efficient paths between metro stations. By representing the metro network as a graph, where stations are nodes and the connections between them are edges, Dijkstra's algorithm can calculate the shortest paths from a specific station to all others. This enables efficient route planning, minimizing travel time and optimizing the overall performance of the metro system. The algorithm's ability to adapt to changes in real-time conditions makes it a valuable asset for ensuring timely and reliable transportation within the Hyderabad Metro network.
